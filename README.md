# Beyond the Fold Visualizers

The visualization tool was constructed in a way such that visible page visit's 
(indicated by a node) can be filtered out by the duration of that visit.

## Usage

Install the newest version of processing and open 
`Visualisation/visualization/visualization.pde`. The graph should be generated 
based on the data in your Safari localstorage.
